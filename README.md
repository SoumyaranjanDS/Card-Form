Contact Card Manager :- 

A modern, fully interactive Contact Card Manager built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project features a polished glassmorphism design, animated gradient background inspired by Sheryians, smooth UI animations, and a dynamic card management experience.

Users can create, view, filter, search, and rotate contact cards while enjoying sleek transitions, 3D tilt effects, and animated interactions.
All data is stored in LocalStorage, allowing the application to function as a lightweight, self-contained personal contact dashboard.
